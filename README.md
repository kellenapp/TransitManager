# TransitManager
# This is a folder with my projects from CMPINF 0401, with the main project being "Final Project"
# Throughout the semester we worked on creating a Transit Manager, assignments 1 and 3 work towards
# the final product. Assignment 2 does not have anything to do with the other projects.
# The code in "Final Project" includes a GUI window that will give you a not so pretty Transit Manager
# with bus and train routes. Allowing you to add drivers to the route, randomize a new route, and more 
# with buttons. You'll find links to all project descriptions in readMe's.
